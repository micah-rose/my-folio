                <p>Howdy!! Welcome to my online portfolio. </p>
                <p>
                    This site is where I will showcase who I am, what I've done, what I'm working on, and most of all... my journey in software and web development.
                    <br />Everything on this landing page was designed by me using ReactJS components and styled with the help of Bootstrap.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I hope you enjoy the content I have put together, but don't get too attached. This is an ever growing and improving portfolio that I will be
                    <br />continuously expanding and downsizing to keep it modern, exciting, and relevant. 
                </p>
                <br />
                <p>Fun Fact: the particle component you see above was inspired by a pair of yoga pants.</p>
