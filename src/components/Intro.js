                    This site is where I will showcase who I am, what I've done, what I'm working on, and 
                    most of all... my journey in software and web development. Everything on this landing page 
                    was designed by me using ReactJS and styled with the help of Bootstrap.

                    I hope you enjoy the content I have put together, but don't get too attached. This is an 
                    ever growing and improving portfolio that I will be continuously expanding and downsizing to 
                    keep it compelling, fun, and relevant to modern technology.
