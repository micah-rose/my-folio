                    The site you have visited is an online portfolio where I showcase who I am, what I've done 
                    and what I'm working on, why I chose tech, and where I'd like to go with my arsenal of code skills. 
                    Everything you'll see on this site was designed by me using ReactJS, JavaScript, and styled with 
                    the help of Bootstrap and CSS.

                    I hope you enjoy the content I have put together, but please, don't get too attached. This is an 
                    ever growing, always improving portfolio and I will be continuously developing it to keep it 
                    intuitive, fun, and relevant to modern technology.
