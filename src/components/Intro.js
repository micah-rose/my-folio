                    Hello there!! I'm Micah and I am the junior software engineer who built this site. Here I 
                    will showcase who I am, what I've done and what I'm working on, and where 
                    I'd like to go with my arsenal of code skills. Everything you'll see on this site was designed 
                    by me using ReactJS, JavaScript, and styled with the help of Bootstrap and CSS.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I hope you enjoy the content I have put together, but please, don't get too attached. This is an 
                    ever growing, always improving portfolio and I will be continuously developing it to keep it 
                    compelling, scalable, fun, and relevant to modern technology. 
                </p>
