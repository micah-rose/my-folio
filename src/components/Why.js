            <p>The last 3 years I have been dedicated to gaining proficient level knowledge in full stack technologies and finding 
            my place among the Silicon Slopes. My strong suit is JavaScript and front end developement, but I strive to be a well rounded 
            engineer and use what I have learned to then help others to succeed in tech. As someone who jumped from a career in management 
            to starting from square one as a developer, I believe the resources for learning to code should be accessible to anyone...
