            <div className="my-story">
                <p>In the year 2016 I decided to enroll myself back into the local community college 
                and end what had been a six year haitus. I originally stopped going to school after realizing 
                I didn't know what I wanted to do with my life and was tired of spending money towards something
                I wasn't passionate about. My decision to return was inspired by my manager at the time and
                in my current role I felt I would have a lot to gain by completing a degree in Business Management.
                Fast forward to 2017 where I made the decision to completely derail my career path. Originally 
                on course towards management, where my original degree choice would have been well used, I soon realized
                there wasn't anyone in those higher level positions who I aspired to be like. I began having
                conversations with colleagues in other departments and took an interest in our Data Solutions department. 
                This was a team that wrote SQL code to develop associate applications using a Microsoft Access database. 
                Everyone I knew on that team appeared to enjoy their jobs and I had heard a career in tech could be promising 
                so I thought "what the hell" and began taking the initiative to join that team.</p>
                <br />
                <p>My first step was to change my degree. Luckily I hadn't gotten into any business specific courses and 
                was able to immediately begin my trek into Computer Science. My first class was SQL Programming and it was 
                the first real experience I had working with code. It was also the first time that I felt that gut feeling
                of "yes, this is right" since I first started my college career, where I had changed my major multiple times
                over the course of many years. Shortly after starting my new journey in obtaining a Computer Science degree, I 
                joined our Data Solutions 
                team and began discovering my passion for developing code. Joining this team led me down additional avenues where
                I saw there was no ceiling and the possibilities were truly endless. What began as a jump to another 
                department for something new turned into the biggest career shift of my life. I felt awakened and wanted to learn
                everything I could about writing code, so I signed up to complete courses in Software Development and Web Programming.
                Two years later, I graduated with my Associate's degree and I can say my gut feeling from before turned out to be spot 
                on.</p>
                <br />
                <p>Leading up to graduation, I had previously joined a Meetup group called Women Who Code where I was able to network 
                and build relationships with others who were already in the field or, like me, wanting to step into it. I had also 
                created a LinkedIn account to further expand my network opportunities. It was an exciting time and I was eager to apply 
                my new skill set with a new company that would allow me to further grow in the industry. Life, however, had other plans. 
                Just before my last semester of college started, I learned I was pregnant. This surprise eventually brought me feelings
                of joy and adoration for what was to come, but if I am to be honest I didn't start off feeling that way. Initially, it
                seemed as though everything I was working for in my career was pulled out from under me and the goals I set for myself 
                all of a sudden became unreachable. In time, I came to realize my new role as a mother was going to give me more strength 
                and determination than I've ever had before. Now, I have a beautiful little boy to join me on my adventures and give me 
                an added purpose in life. After my maternity leave was over and I had taken the time to be a mama, I picked myself up from 
                where I left off and continued my ambition to gain proficieny as a full stack software engineer. Since then I have been 
                following the self taught path to further my understanding of how to develop scalable, quality-driven software applications
                and how the impact of technology shapes our world.</p>
